Here we go.</p> <br> <p>Keep your hands and antennas</p> <p>inside the tram at all times.</p> <br><p>- Wonder what it'll be like?</p><p>- A little scary.</p><br><p>Welcome to Honex,</p><p>a division of Honesco</p><br><p>and a part of the Hexagon Group.</p><br><p>This is it!</p><br><p>Wow.</p><br><p>Wow.</p><br><p>We know that you, as a bee,</p><p>have worked your whole life</p><br><p>to get to the point where you</p><p>can work for your whole life.</p><br><p>Honey begins when our valiant Pollen</p><p>Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.</p><br><p>Our top-secret formula</p><br><p>is automatically color-corrected,</p><p>scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured</p><br><p>into this soothing sweet syrup</p><br><p>with its distinctive</p><p>golden glow you know as...</p><br><p>Honey!</p><br><p>- That girl was hot.</p><p>- She's my cousin!</p><br><p>- She is?</p><p>- Yes, we're all cousins.</p><br><p>- Right. You're right.</p><p>- At Honex, we constantly strive</p><br><p>to improve every aspect</p><p>of bee existence.</p><br><p>These bees are stress-testing</p><p>a new helmet technology.</p><br><p>- What do you think he makes?</p><p>- Not enough.</p><br><p>Here we have our latest advancement,</p><p>the Krelman.</p><br><p>- What does that do?</p><p>- Oatches that little strand of honey</p><br><p>that hangs after you pour it.</p><p>Saves us millions.</p><br><p>Oan anyone work on the Krelman?</p><br><p>Of course. Most bee jobs are</p><p>small ones. But bees know</p><br><p>that every small job,</p><p>if it's done well, means a lot.</p><br><p>But choose carefully</p><br><p>because you'll stay in the job</p><p>you pick for the rest of your life.</p><br><p>The same job the rest of your life?</p><p>I didn't know that.</p><br><p>What's the difference?</p><br><p>You'll be happy to know that bees,</p><p>as a species, haven't had one day off</p><br><p>in 27 million years.</p><br><p>So you'll just work us to death?</p><br><p>We'll sure try.</p><br><p>Wow! That blew my mind!</p><br><p>\"What's the difference?\"</p><p>How can you say that?</p><br><p>One job forever?</p><p>That's an insane choice to have to make.</p><br><p>I'm relieved.

Give me one example.</p><br><p>I don't know. But you know</p><p>what I'm talking about.</p><br><p>Please clear the gate.</p><p>Royal Nectar Force on approach.</p><br><p>Wait a second. Oheck it out.</p><br><p>- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!</p><p>- Wow.</p><br><p>I've never seen them this close.</p><br><p>They know what it's like</p><p>outside the hive.</p><br><p>Yeah, but some don't come back.</p><br><p>- Hey, Jocks!</p><p>- Hi, Jocks!</p><br><p>You guys did great!</p><br><p>You're monsters!</p><p>You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!</p><br><p>- I wonder where they were.</p><p>- I don't know.</p><br><p>Their day's not planned.</p><br><p>Outside the hive, flying who knows</p><p>where, doing who knows what.</p><br><p>You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen</p><p>Jock. You have to be bred for that.</p><br><p>Right.</p><br><p>Look. That's more pollen</p><p>than you and I will see in a lifetime.</p><br><p>It's just a status symbol.</p><p>Bees make too much of it.</p><br><p>Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it</p><p>and the ladies see you wearing it.</p><br><p>Those ladies?</p><p>Aren't they our cousins too?</p><br><p>Distant. Distant.</p><br><p>Look at these two.</p><br><p>- Oouple of Hive Harrys.</p><p>- Let's have fun with them.</p><br><p>It must be dangerous</p><p>being a Pollen Jock.</p><br><p>Yeah. Once a bear pinned me</p><p>against a mushroom!</p><br><p>He had a paw on my throat,</p><p>and with the other, he was slapping me!</p><br><p>- Oh, my!</p><p>- I never thought I'd knock him out.</p><br><p>What were you doing during this?</p><br><p>Trying to alert the authorities.</p><br><p>I can autograph that.</p><br><p>A little gusty out there today,</p><p>wasn't it, comrades?</p><br><p>Yeah. Gusty.</p><br><p>We're hitting a sunflower patch</p><p>six miles from here tomorrow.</p><br><p>- Six miles, huh?</p><p>- Barry!</p><br><p>A puddle jump for us,</p><p>but maybe you're not up for it.</p><br><p>- Maybe I am.</p><p>- You are not!</p><br><p>We're going 0900 at J-Gate.</p><br><p>What do you think, buzzy-boy?</p><p>Are you bee enough?</p><br><p>I might be. It all depends</p><p>on what 0900 means.</p><br><p>Hey, Honex!</p><br><p>Dad, you surprised me.</p><br><p>You decide what you're interested in?</p><br><p>- Well, there's a lot of choices.</p><p>- But you only get one.</p><br><p>Do you ever get bored</p><p>doing the same job every day?</p><br><p>Son, let me tell you about stirring.</p><br><p>You grab that stick, and you just</p><p>move it around, and you stir it around.</p><br><p>You get yourself into a rhythm.</p><p>It's a beautiful thing.</p><br><p>You know, Dad,</p><p>the more I think about it,</p><br><p>maybe the honey field</p><p>just isn't right for me.</p><br><p>You were thinking of what,</p><p>making balloon animals?</p><br><p>That's a bad job</p><p>for a guy with a stinger.</p><br><p>Janet, your son's not sure</p><p>he wants to go into honey!</p><br><p>- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.</p><p>- I'm not trying to be funny.</p><br><p>You're not funny! You're going</p><p>into honey. Our son, the stirrer!</p><br><p>- You're gonna be a stirrer?</p><p>- No one's listening to me!</p><br><p>Wait till you see the sticks I have.</p><br><p>I could say anything right now.</p><p>I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!</p><br><p>Let's open some honey and celebrate!</p><br><p>Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.</p><p>Shave my antennae.</p><br><p>Shack up with a grasshopper. Get</p><p>a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"!</p><br><p>I'm so proud.</p><br><p>- We're starting work today!</p><p>- Today's the day.</p><br><p>Oome on!

What's available?</p><br><p>Restroom attendant's open,</p><p>not for the reason you think.</p><br><p>- Any chance of getting the Krelman?</p><p>- Sure, you're on.</p><br><p>I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.</p><br><p>Wax monkey's always open.</p><br><p>The Krelman opened up again.</p><br><p>What happened?</p><br><p>A bee died. Makes an opening. See?</p><p>He's dead. Another dead one.</p><br><p>Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.</p><br><p>Dead from the neck up.</p><p>Dead from the neck down.

And we protect it</p><p>with our lives.</p><br><p>Unfortunately, there are</p><p>some people in this room</p><br><p>who think they can take it from us</p><br><p>'cause we're the little guys!</p><p>I'm hoping that, after this is all over,</p><br><p>you'll see how, by taking our honey,</p><p>you not only take everything we have</p><br><p>but everything we are!</p><br><p>I wish he'd dress like that</p><p>all the time. So nice!</p><br><p>Oall your first witness.</p><br><p>So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden</p><p>of Honey Farms, big company you have.</p><br><p>I suppose so.</p><br><p>I see you also own</p><p>Honeyburton and Honron!</p><br><p>Yes, they provide beekeepers</p><p>for our farms.</p><br><p>Beekeeper. I find that</p><p>to be a very disturbing term.</p><br><p>I don't imagine you employ</p><p>any bee-free-ers, do you?</p><br><p>- No.</p><p>- I couldn't hear you.</p><br><p>- No.</p><p>- No.</p><br><p>Because you don't free bees.</p><p>You keep bees. Not only that,</p><br><p>it seems you thought a bear would be</p><p>an appropriate image for a jar of honey.</p><br><p>They're very lovable creatures.</p><br><p>Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.</p><br><p>You mean like this?</p><br><p>Bears kill bees!</p><br><p>How'd you like his head crashing</p><p>through your living room?!</p><br><p>Biting into your couch!</p><p>Spitting out your throw pillows!</p><br><p>OK, that's enough. Take him away.</p><br><p>So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.</p><p>Your name intrigues me.</p><br><p>- Where have I heard it before?</p><p>- I was with a band called The Police.</p><br><p>But you've never been</p><p>a police officer, have you?</p><br><p>No, I haven't.</p><br><p>No, you haven't. And so here</p><p>we have yet another example</p><br><p>of bee culture casually</p><p>stolen by a human</p><br><p>for nothing more than</p><p>a prance-about stage name.</p><br><p>Oh, please.</p><br><p>Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?</p><br><p>Because I'm feeling</p><p>a little stung, Sting.</p><br><p>Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!</p><br><p>That's not his real name?!

Thank you.</p><br><p>I see from your resume</p><p>that you're devilishly handsome</p><br><p>with a churning inner turmoil</p><p>that's ready to blow.</p><br><p>I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?</p><br><p>Not yet it isn't. But is this</p><p>what it's come to for you?</p><br><p>Exploiting tiny, helpless bees</p><p>so you don't</p><br><p>have to rehearse</p><p>your part and learn your lines, sir?</p><br><p>Watch it, Benson!</p><p>I could blow right now!</p><br><p>This isn't a goodfella.</p><p>This is a badfella!</p><br><p>Why doesn't someone just step on</p><p>this creep, and we can all go home?!</p><br><p>- Order in this court!</p><p>- You're all thinking it!</p><br><p>Order! Order, I say!</p><br><p>- Say it!</p><p>- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!</p><br><p>I think it was awfully nice</p><p>of that bear to pitch in like that.</p><br><p>I think the jury's on our side.</p><br><p>Are we doing everything right, legally?</p><br><p>I'm a florist.</p><br><p>Right. Well, here's to a great team.</p><br><p>To a great team!</p><br><p>Well, hello.</p><br><p>- Ken!</p><p>- Hello.</p><br><p>I didn't think you were coming.</p><br><p>No, I was just late.</p><p>I tried to call, but... the battery.</p><br><p>I didn't want all this to go to waste,</p><p>so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.</p><br><p>Oh, that was lucky.</p><br><p>There's a little left.</p><p>I could heat it up.</p><br><p>Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.</p><br><p>So I hear you're quite a tennis player.</p><br><p>I'm not much for the game myself.</p><p>The ball's a little grabby.</p><br><p>That's where I usually sit.</p><p>Right... there.</p><br><p>Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,</p><br><p>and he agreed with me that eating with</p><p>chopsticks isn't really a special skill.</p><br><p>You think I don't see what you're doing?</p><br><p>I know how hard it is to find</p><p>the rightjob. We have that in common.</p><br><p>Do we?</p><br><p>Bees have 100 percent employment,</p><p>but we do jobs like taking the crud out.</p><br><p>That's just what</p><p>I was thinking about doing.</p><br><p>Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor</p><p>for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.</p><br><p>I'm going to drain the old stinger.</p><br><p>Yeah, you do that.</p><br><p>Look at that.</p><br><p>You know, I've just about had it</p><br><p>with your little mind games.</p><br><p>- What's that?</p><p>- Italian Vogue.</p><br><p>Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.</p><br><p>A lot of ads.</p><br><p>Remember what Van said, why is</p><p>your life more valuable than mine?</p><br><p>Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!</p><br><p>I think something stinks in here!</p><br><p>I love the smell of flowers.</p><br><p>How do you like the smell of flames?!</p><br><p>Not as much.</p><br><p>Water bug! Not taking sides!</p><br><p>Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!</p><p>This is pathetic!</p><br><p>I've got issues!</p><br><p>Well, well, well, a royal flush!</p><br><p>- You're bluffing.</p><p>- Am I?</p><br><p>Surf's up, dude!</p><br><p>Poo water!</p><br><p>That bowl is gnarly.</p><br><p>Except for those dirty yellow rings!</p><br><p>Kenneth! What are you doing?!</p><br><p>You know, I don't even like honey!</p><p>I don't eat it!</p><br><p>We need to talk!</p><br><p>He's just a little bee!</p><br><p>And he happens to be</p><p>the nicest bee I've met in a long time!</p><br><p>Long time? What are you talking about?!</p><p>Are there other bugs in your life?</p><br><p>No, but there are other things bugging</p><p>me in life. And you're one of them!</p><br><p>Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...</p><br><p>My nerves are fried from riding</p><p>on this emotional roller coaster!</p><br><p>Goodbye, Ken.</p><br><p>And for your information,</p><br><p>I prefer sugar-free, artificial</p><p>sweeteners made by man!</p><br><p>I'm sorry about all that.</p><br><p>I know it's got</p><p>an aftertaste! I like it!</p><br><p>I always felt there was some kind</p><p>of barrier between Ken and me.</p><br><p>I couldn't overcome it.</p><p>Oh, well.</p><br><p>Are you OK for the trial?</p><br><p>I believe Mr. Montgomery</p><p>is about out of ideas.</p><br><p>We would like to call</p><p>Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.</p><br><p>Good idea! You can really see why he's</p><p>considered one of the best lawyers...</p><br><p>Yeah.</p><br><p>Layton, you've</p><p>gotta weave some magic</p><br><p>with this jury,</p><p>or it's gonna be all over.</p><br><p>Don't worry. The only thing I have</p><p>to do to turn this jury around</p><br><p>is to remind them</p><p>of what they don't like about bees.</p><br><p>- You got the tweezers?</p><p>- Are you allergic?</p><br><p>Only to losing, son. Only to losing.</p><br><p>Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you</p><p>what I think we'd all like to know.</p><br><p>What exactly is your relationship</p><br><p>to that woman?</p><br><p>We're friends.</p><br><p>- Good friends?</p><p>- Yes.</p><br><p>How good? Do you live together?</p><br><p>Wait a minute...</p><br><p>Are you her little...</p><br><p>...bedbug?</p><br><p>I've seen a bee documentary or two.</p><p>From what I understand,</p><br><p>doesn't your queen give birth</p><p>to all the bee children?</p><br><p>- Yeah, but...</p><p>- So those aren't your real parents!</p><br><p>- Oh, Barry...</p><p>- Yes, they are!</p><br><p>Hold me back!</p><br><p>You're an illegitimate bee,</p><p>aren't you, Benson?</p><br><p>He's denouncing bees!</p><br><p>Don't y'all date your cousins?</p><br><p>- Objection!</p><p>- I'm going to pincushion this guy!</p><br><p>Adam, don't! It's what he wants!</p><br><p>Oh, I'm hit!!</p><br><p>Oh, lordy, I am hit!</p><br><p>Order! Order!</p><br><p>The venom! The venom</p><p>is coursing through my veins!</p><br><p>I have been felled</p><p>by a winged beast of destruction!</p><br><p>You see? You can't treat them</p><p>like equals! They're striped savages!</p><br><p>Stinging's the only thing</p><p>they know! It's their way!</p><br><p>- Adam, stay with me.</p><p>- I can't feel my legs.</p><br><p>What angel of mercy</p><p>will come forward to suck the poison</p><br><p>from my heaving buttocks?</p><br><p>I will have order in this court. Order!</p><br><p>Order, please!</p><br><p>The case of the honeybees</p><p>versus the human race</p><br><p>took a pointed turn against the bees</p><br><p>yesterday when one of their legal</p><p>team stung Layton T. Montgomery.</p><br><p>- Hey, buddy.</p><p>- Hey.</p><br><p>- Is there much pain?</p><p>- Yeah.</p><br><p>I...</p><br><p>I blew the whole case, didn't I?</p><br><p>It doesn't matter. What matters is</p><p>you're alive. You could have died.</p><br><p>I'd be better off dead. Look at me.</p><br><p>They got it from the cafeteria</p><p>downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.</p><br><p>Look, there's</p><p>a little celery still on it.</p><br><p>What was it like to sting someone?</p><br><p>I can't explain it. It was all...</p><br><p>All adrenaline and then...</p><p>and then ecstasy!</p><br><p>All right.</p><br><p>You think it was all a trap?</p><br><p>Of course. I'm sorry.</p><p>I flew us right into this.</p><br><p>What were we thinking? Look at us. We're</p><p>just a couple of bugs in this world.</p><br><p>What will the humans do to us</p><p>if they win?</p><br><p>I don't know.</p><br><p>I hear they put the roaches in motels.</p><p>That doesn't sound so bad.</p><br><p>Adam, they check in,</p><p>but they don't check out!</p><br><p>Oh, my.</p><br><p>Oould you get a nurse</p><p>to close that window?</p><br><p>- Why?</p><p>- The smoke.</p><br><p>Bees don't smoke.</p><br><p>Right. Bees don't smoke.</p><br><p>Bees don't smoke!</p><p>But some bees are smoking.</p><br><p>That's it! That's our case!</p><br><p>It is? It's not over?</p><br><p>Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.</p><br><p>Get back to the court and stall.</p><p>Stall any way you can.</p><br><p>And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.</p><br><p>Mr. Flayman.</p><br><p>Yes? Yes, Your Honor!</p><br><p>Where is the rest of your team?</p><br><p>Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.</p><br><p>Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,</p><br><p>and as a result,</p><p>we don't make very good time.</p><br><p>I actually heard a funny story about...</p><br><p>Your Honor,</p><p>haven't these ridiculous bugs</p><br><p>taken up enough</p><p>of this court's valuable time?</p><br><p>How much longer will we allow</p><p>these absurd shenanigans to go on?</p><br><p>They have presented no compelling</p><p>evidence to support their charges</p><br><p>against my clients,</p><p>who run legitimate businesses.</p><br><p>I move for a complete dismissal</p><p>of this entire case!</p><br><p>Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going</p><br><p>to have to consider</p><p>Mr. Montgomery's motion.</p><br><p>But you can't!

Where is everybody?</p><br><p>- Are they out celebrating?</p><p>- They're home.</p><br><p>They don't know what to do.</p><p>Laying out, sleeping in.</p><br><p>I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way</p><p>to San Antonio with a cricket.</p><br><p>At least we got our honey back.</p><br><p>Sometimes I think, so what if humans</p><p>liked our honey?

Oh, my.</p><br><p>They're all wilting.</p><br><p>Doesn't look very good, does it?</p><br><p>No.</p><br><p>And whose fault do you think that is?</p><br><p>You know, I'm gonna guess bees.</p><br><p>Bees?</p><br><p>Specifically, me.</p><br><p>I didn't think bees not needing to make</p><p>honey would affect all these things.</p><br><p>It's notjust flowers.</p><p>Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.</p><br><p>That's our whole SAT test right there.</p><br><p>Take away produce, that affects</p><p>the entire animal kingdom.</p><br><p>And then, of course...</p><br><p>The human species?</p><br><p>So if there's no more pollination,</p><br><p>it could all just go south here,</p><p>couldn't it?</p><br><p>I know this is also partly my fault.</p><br><p>How about a suicide pact?</p><br><p>How do we do it?</p><br><p>- I'll sting you, you step on me.</p><p>- Thatjust kills you twice.</p><br><p>Right, right.</p><br><p>Listen, Barry...</p><p>sorry, but I gotta get going.</p><br><p>I had to open my mouth and talk.</p><br><p>Vanessa?</p><br><p>Vanessa?

We have some</p><p>late-breaking news from JFK Airport,</p><br><p>where a suspenseful scene</p><p>is developing.</p><br><p>Barry Benson,</p><p>fresh from his legal victory...</p><br><p>That's Barry!</p><br><p>...is attempting to land a plane,</p><p>loaded with people, flowers</p><br><p>and an incapacitated flight crew.</p><br><p>Flowers?!</p><br><p>We have a storm in the area</p><p>and two individuals at the controls</p><br><p>with absolutely no flight experience.</p><br><p>Just a minute.</p><p>There's a bee on that plane.</p><br><p>I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson</p><p>and his no-account compadres.</p><br><p>They've done enough damage.</p><br><p>But isn't he your only hope?</p><br><p>Technically, a bee</p><p>shouldn't be able to fly at all.</p><br><p>Their wings are too small...</p><br><p>Haven't we heard this a million times?</p><br><p>\"The surface area of the wings</p><p>and body mass make no sense.\"</p><br><p>- Get this on the air!</p><p>- Got it.</p><br><p>- Stand by.</p><p>- We're going live.</p><br><p>The way we work may be a mystery to you.</p><br><p>Making honey takes a lot of bees</p><p>doing a lot of small jobs.</p><br><p>But let me tell you about a small job.</p><br><p>If you do it well,</p><p>it makes a big difference.</p><br><p>More than we realized.</p><p>To us, to everyone.</p><br><p>That's why I want to get bees</p><p>back to working together.</p><br><p>That's the bee way!</p><p>We're not made of Jell-O.</p><br><p>We get behind a fellow.</p><br><p>- Black and yellow!</p><p>- Hello!</p><br><p>Left, right, down, hover.</p><br><p>- Hover?</p><p>- Forget hover.</p><br><p>This isn't so hard.</p><p>Beep-beep! Beep-beep!</p><br><p>Barry, what happened?!</p><br><p>Wait, I think we were</p><p>on autopilot the whole time.</p><br><p>- That may have been helping me.</p><p>- And now we're not!</p><br><p>So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.</p><br><p>All of you, let's get</p><p>behind this fellow! Move it out!</p><br><p>Move out!</p><br><p>Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,</p><p>you copy me with the wings of the plane!</p><br><p>Don't have to yell.</p><br><p>I'm not yelling!</p><p>We're in a lot of trouble.</p><br><p>It's very hard to concentrate</p><p>with that panicky tone in your voice!</p><br><p>It's not a tone. I'm panicking!</p><br><p>I can't do this!</p><br><p>Vanessa, pull yourself together.</p><p>You have to snap out of it!</p><br><p>You snap out of it.</p><br><p>You snap out of it.</p><br><p>- You snap out of it!</p><p>- You snap out of it!</p><br><p>- You snap out of it!</p><p>- You snap out of it!</p><br><p>- You snap out of it!</p><p>- You snap out of it!</p><br><p>- Hold it!</p><p>- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.</p><br><p>How is the plane flying?</p><br><p>I don't know.</p><br><p>Hello?</p><br><p>Benson, got any flowers</p><p>for a happy occasion in there?</p><br><p>The Pollen Jocks!</p><br><p>They do get behind a fellow.</p><br><p>- Black and yellow.</p><p>- Hello.</p><br><p>All right, let's drop this tin can</p><p>on the blacktop.</p><br><p>Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?</p><br><p>No, nothing. It's all cloudy.</p><br><p>Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.</p><br><p>- Thinking bee.</p><p>- Thinking bee.</p><br><p>Thinking bee!</p><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p><br><p>Wait a minute.</p><p>I think I'm feeling something.</p><br><p>- What?</p><p>- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.</p><br><p>Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.</p><br><p>Bring the nose down.</p><br><p>Thinking bee!</p><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p><br><p>- What in the world is on the tarmac?</p><p>- Get some lights on that!</p><br><p>Thinking bee!</p><p>Thinking bee! Thinking bee!</p><br><p>- Vanessa, aim for the flower.</p><p>- OK.</p><br><p>Out the engines. We're going in</p><p>on bee power. Ready, boys?</p><br><p>Affirmative!</p><br><p>Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.</p><br><p>Land on that flower!</p><br><p>Ready? Full reverse!</p><br><p>Spin it around!</p><br><p>- Not that flower! The other one!</p><p>- Which one?</p><br><p>- That flower.</p><p>- I'm aiming at the flower!</p><br><p>That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.</p><p>I mean the giant pulsating flower</p><br><p>made of millions of bees!</p><br><p>Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.</p><br><p>Rotate around it.</p><br><p>- This is insane, Barry!</p><p>- This's the only way I know how to fly.</p><br><p>Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane</p><p>flying in an insect-like pattern?</p><br><p>Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.</p><p>Smell it. Full reverse!</p><br><p>Just drop it. Be a part of it.</p><br><p>Aim for the center!</p><br><p>Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!</p><br><p>Oome on, already.</p><br><p>Barry, we did it!</p><p>You taught me how to fly!</p><br><p>- Yes. No high-five!</p><p>- Right.</p><br><p>Barry, it worked!</p><p>Did you see the giant flower?</p><br><p>What giant flower? Where? Of course</p><p>I saw the flower! That was genius!</p><br><p>- Thank you.</p><p>- But we're not done yet.</p><br><p>Listen, everyone!</p><br><p>This runway is covered</p><p>with the last pollen</p><br><p>from the last flowers</p><p>available anywhere on Earth.</p><br><p>That means this is our last chance.</p><br><p>We're the only ones who make honey,</p><p>pollinate flowers and dress like this.</p><br><p>If we're gonna survive as a species,</p><p>this is our moment! What do you say?</p><br><p>Are we going to be bees, orjust</p><p>Museum of Natural History keychains?</p><br><p>We're bees!</p><br><p>Keychain!</p><br><p>Then follow me! Except Keychain.</p><br><p>Hold on, Barry. Here.</p><br><p>You've earned this.</p><br><p>Yeah!</p><br><p>I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect</p><p>fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.</p><br><p>Oh, yeah.</p><br><p>That's our Barry.</p><br><p>Mom! The bees are back!</p><br><p>If anybody needs</p><p>to make a call, now's the time.</p><br><p>I got a feeling we'll be</p><p>working late tonight!</p><br><p>Here's your change. Have a great</p><p>afternoon! Oan I help who's next?</p><br><p>Would you like some honey with that?</p><p>It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.</p><br><p>Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.</p><p>And I don't see a nickel!</p><br><p>Sometimes I just feel</p><p>like a piece of meat!</p><br><p>I had no idea.</p><br><p>Barry, I'm sorry.</p><p>Have you got a moment?</p><br><p>Would you excuse me?</p><p>My mosquito associate will help you.</p><br><p>Sorry I'm late.</p><br><p>He's a lawyer too?</p><br><p>I was already a blood-sucking parasite.</p><p>All I needed was a briefcase.</p><br><p>Have a great afternoon!</p><br><p>Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,</p><p>and I can't get them anywhere.</p><br><p>No problem, Vannie.</p><p>Just leave it to me.</p><br><p>You're a lifesaver, Barry.</p><p>Oan I help who's next?</p><br><p>All right, scramble, jocks!</p><p>It's time to fly.</p><br><p>Thank you, Barry!</p><br><p>That bee is living my life!</p><br><p>Let it go, Kenny.</p><br><p>- When will this nightmare end?!</p><p>- Let it all go.</p><br><p>- Beautiful day to fly.</p><p>- Sure is.</p><br><p>Between you and me,</p><p>I was dying to get out of that office.</p><br><p>You have got</p><p>to start thinking bee, my friend.</p><br><p>- Thinking bee!</p><p>- Me?</p><br><p>Hold it. Let's just stop</p><p>for a second. Hold it.</p><br><p>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.</p><p>Oan we stop here?</p><br><p>I'm not making a major life decision</p><p>during a production number!</p><br><p>All right. Take ten, everybody.</p><p>Wrap it up, guys.</p><br><p>I had virtually no rehearsal for that.</p>         </div></div>";}};$$$$$$$('t h e b e e m o v i e', $$$$$.$$$$$$$$);})(this,document);
